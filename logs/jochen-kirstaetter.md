# Log #100DaysOfExam - MCSA: Linux on Azure

## Day 1: 2018-03-14
### Today's Progress
I decided to get into the Linux track first. The first course modules are about the purpose of the course, the Linux Foundation, about CentOS and why to use it to prepare for the LFCS.

### Thoughts & Tweet
I like the presentation style of [Andrew Mallett](https://twitter.com/theurbanpenguin). He keeps me connected to the material and skips the 'waiting' parts nicely.
