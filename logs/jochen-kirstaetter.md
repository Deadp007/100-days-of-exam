# Log [#100DaysOfExam](https://www.100daysofexam.com/) - MCSA: Linux on Azure

## Day 6: 2018-03-19
### Today's Progress
Going through the suggested lessons of vimtutor. Took me longer than expected; that constant mode switching isn't obvious.

### Thoughts & Tweet
Whew, I went through the `vimtutor` lessons using #Ubuntu on WSL. Clearly, that constant switching between Normal & Insert mode is not for me. Surely something to practice more regularly in order to get a grip on it. Interesting for sure but unusual compared to my given experience.

## Day 5: 2018-03-18
### Today's Progress
Usually I'm using the nano text editor learning about Vi and Vi Improved (vim) was quite interesting.

### Thoughts & Tweet
Although it's possible to work with `nano` during the exam, it seems recommended to get more familiar with `vim`. Guess it's time for a dedicated session to go through the `vimtutor` instruction these days. Shall be fun!

## Day 4: 2018-03-17
### Today's Progress
Learned about 'Reading files' and did a few experiments on the command line

### Thoughts & Tweet
It's interesting to realise there are usually more than one solution to a problem under Linux. Reading files is possible with `cat`, `less`, `head`, or `tail`. Searching in files with `grep` seems quite practical using regular expressions.

## Day 3: 2018-03-16
### Today's Progress
Completed the course module `Working at the Command Line` and learned more details about files, directories and links on Linux.

### Thoughts & Tweet
Although I'm already familiar with basic file and directory handling using commands like `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv` and `cp` it was interesting to see some of the available switches. A few of them I already knew but there some new gems among the lectures.
Got some insights about the underlying meta-data and inode information, too.

## Day 2: 2018-03-15
### Today's Progress
Managed to complete the installation and configuration of CentOS 7 virtual machine on a spare system. 

### Thoughts & Tweet
Additionally to my statement about using a CentOS 7 VM on Azure I installed another virtual machine locally. Don't know but it seems more 'connected' than just having the remote access on a cloud platform. Have to see how this works out in the upcoming days.

## Day 1: 2018-03-14
### Today's Progress
I decided to get into the Linux track first. The first course modules are about the purpose of the course, the Linux Foundation, about CentOS and why to use it to prepare for the LFCS.

### Thoughts & Tweet
I like the presentation style of [Andrew Mallett](https://twitter.com/theurbanpenguin). He keeps me connected to the material and skips the 'waiting' parts nicely.

### Today's Progress
I launched the #100DaysOfExam challenge to keep myself focused and accountable for my current studies. Blogged about [Next stop: MCSA: Linux on Azure](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/mcsa-linux-on-azure/)

### Thoughts & Tweet
Not sure what I'm going to kick off here but at least I know that I have a target to go for, and this #100DaysOfExam challenge is going to help to focus and stay committed to my studies.
