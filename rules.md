# Rules of #100DaysOfExam Challenge

## Main Commitment a.k.a. Rule #1
### *I will learn and prepare for an exam for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfExam
1. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
1. I will prepare for a real exam. Specify your goal in the title of your log file to keep it in eyesight.

## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add at least one link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a tutorial, a video or any other resource that helped you to prepare for your exam.
1. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
